            <span class="description__indent">Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle</span> is a 2009 book by Dan Senor and Saul Singer about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Israel" class="economy-israel">
                economy of
                Israel
            </a>.[1] It examines how Israel, a 60-year-old nation with a population of 7.1 million, was able to reach such
            economic growth that "at the start of 2009, some 63 Israeli companies were listed on the NASDAQ, more than those of any
            other foreign country."[2]
            </p>
            <p>In 2010, Start-up Nation was ranked fifth on the business bestseller list of The New York Times.[3] It also reached The
            Wall Street Journal bestseller list.

            <h2>
                Book overview
            </h2>
            <p>The Council on Foreign Relations states in its publisher's blurb for the book that Start-up Nation addresses the
            question: "How is it that Israel—a country of 7.1 million people, only sixty years old, surrounded by enemies, in a
            constant state of war since its founding, with no natural resources—produces more start-up companies on a per capita
            basis than large, peaceful, and stable nations and regions like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada, and all of
            Europe?"[5] The Economist notes that Israel now has more high-tech start-ups and a larger venture capital industry per
            capita than any other country in the world. The success of Israel's high-tech sector over the past two decades has
            attracted recent attention from business journalists and The Economist describes Start-up Nation as the most notable of
            a "growing pile" of books on the subject.</p>
            <p>
                In their attempt to explain Israel's success in this area, Senor and Singer discard "the argument from ethnic or
                religious exceptionalism, dismissing 'unitary Jewishness' or even individual talent as major reasons for Israel's
                high-tech success" and analyze two major factors that, in the authors' opinion, contribute most to Israel's economic
                growth. Those factors are mandatory military service and immigration.
            </p>
            <p>The authors argue that a major factor for Israel's economic growth can be found in the culture of the Israel Defense
            Forces, in which service is mandatory for most young Israelis. The authors believe that IDF service provides potential
            entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service
            provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively un-hierarchical environment where creativity and
            intelligence are highly valued.[7] IDF soldiers "have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even
            if this means breaking some rules. If you're a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you
            see them doing something wrong, you say so."[2] Neither ranks nor ages matter much "when taxi drivers can command
            millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles," and "Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders."</p>

            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>Journalists and policymakers in several countries have recommended Start-up Nation as a useful guide for promoting
            entrepreneurship. A review of the book in The Irish Times calls on Ireland to follow Israel's model.[22] Andrius
            Kubilius, the prime minister of Lithuania, has cited Start-up Nation as his favorite book.[23] Yrjö Ojasaar, managing
            partner of Solon Partners, an executive consulting and angel investor company in Estonia, says "there is much to be
            learned from the Israeli experience of venture capital incubation through building incentives for privatization."[24]
            CNN's Fareed Zakaria called Start-up Nation "a book every single Arab businessman, Arab bureaucrat, and Arab politician
            should read."[25] The book is cited as a handbook of "classic economics." It teaches small businesses "how effective a
            cohesive team can be, especially when that team places an emphasis on chutzpah first."</p>
            <p>Former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad reportedly kept a copy of Start-up Nation on his desk as a source of
            inspiration for the West Bank's own burgeoning technology industry.</p>
            <p>To some extent, the expression "Startup Nation" has helped to materialise the ambition of French President Emmanuel
            Macron for France to impulse the high-technology sector in France from 2017 onward.</p>
